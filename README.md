# Lounsbery project: Microbiome in the museum

### Synopsis
The microbiome represents the border between humans and their environment. However, whether the microbiome can be leveraged to gain information on the human interaction with museum objects is unclear. To answer this question, a list of art objects from the [Pergamon](https://www.smb.museum/en/museums-institutions/pergamonmuseum/home/) and [Naturkunde](https://www.museumfuernaturkunde.berlin/en) museums in Berlin ranging in material and size was defined. Selection of the objects was motivated by optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio. Objects of comparable material yet with varying degrees of exposure to human interaction were prioritized. Samples were taken with certified DNA-free and sterile nylon flocked swabs. Samples were subsequently subjected to 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. This repo contains data and analysis code for this project.
